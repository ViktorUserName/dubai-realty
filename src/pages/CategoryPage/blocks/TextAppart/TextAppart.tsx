Everything was interesting to her. She knew nothing. I knew everythingâ€¦been there, done that. She was in the moment, I was in the past. She was mindful. I was mindless.</p>

The same is true as we experience the emotional sensation of stress from our first instances of social rejection or ridicule. We quickly learn to fear and thus automatically avoid potentially stressful situations of all kinds, including the most common of all: making mistakes.</p>
